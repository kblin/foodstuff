FoodStuff
=========

FoodStuff is a web-app that allpws you to manage recipes, plan meals, and then
organize your shopping list according to the meals planned.

Installation
------------

I recommend using `python-virtualenv` to set up a dedicated environment. Then,
you need to install `flask` and `flask-sqlalchemy`.
